UniBook, also known as the Uniform Book System, is an Android application designed to help students who have difficulties purchasing uniforms.

UniBook was built on the Android Studio development platform, which includes essential components such as the User Interface (UI), Plugin System, Build System, Code Editor, Emulator, and more. These components work together to improve the system's functionality and efficiency. With Android Studio, we have a complete environment for designing, building, and testing the Uniform Booking system.

How Unibook was made by using the following:
  - Android Studio
  - Kotlin (Why do I use Kotlin instead of Java? Well, I love trying new things, and since I already have a good understanding of Java, I decided to give Kotlin a try. According to Android Studio, Kotlin is the official language for Android development. They claim that it reduces the amount of code you need to write.)
  - IIS (Interent Information Services)
  - Retrofit2 (Framework Android Studio)
