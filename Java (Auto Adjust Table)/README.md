How did I create this project?

Table Initialization It begins by creating a table structure using a 2D array Table to define columns (ProductID, ProductName, etc.).
I create Item Class It defines an Item class that represents individual items with properties like ID, Name, Description, Price, Quantity, and Category.
Calculating Maximum Lengths. The code then iterates through the Table and Items arrays to find the maximum length of certain properties (ProductName, Description, etc.) and updates the lengths in the Table accordingly.
Displaying Table Headers It prints the table headers by considering the maximum lengths of the columns.
Displaying Separator Prints a separator for the table.
Displaying Item Information Finally, it displays the information for each item in a formatted manner based on the maximum lengths defined earlier in the Table.
